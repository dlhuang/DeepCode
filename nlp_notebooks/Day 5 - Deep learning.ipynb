    "# Deep learning for text mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical course material for the ASDM Class 09 (Text Mining) by Florian Leitner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Â© 2017 Florian Leitner. All rights reserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this course, we've worked with two datasets: the *20 Newsgroups* (day 1) and the *Reuters-21578* (day 3) datasets.\n",
    "In this last exercise, we will re-run the classification with a neural network and try to beat [the best *published* results](http://clair.si.umich.edu/%7Eradev/papers/tc.pdf) from models *other* than neural networks.\n",
    "(If you like, particularly 20 Newsgroups is the equivalent of \"MINST\" for computer vision, but for text mining.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For those two corpora, the best (non-neural) baselines achieve around 90% accuracy on the 20 Newsgroups  coprus, using the official (roughly 3:2) split (see below!). Even we, on day one, achieved around 85% accuracy on this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For Retuers-21578, the state-of-the-art (\"ante deep learning\") was 94% micro-averaged $F_1$ Score using the official ModApte split, but only selecting documents among the ten most frequent categories (200 or more documents), and a micro-averaged 89% $F_1$ Score is using all 90 categories.\n",
    "And, obviously, it is important that the evaluation follows a single multilabel classification setting, not 10 or 90 individual binary classification problems... Most deep lerning literature only focuses on the simpler 10-categories subset of Reuter-21578, because otherwise there are too few examples to work with, so the number you should keep in mind for that set when reading a new deep learning paper using it is the 94% micro-averaged $F_1$ score.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for this last tutorial will be trying to beat the state-of-the-art with deep learning, to better understand how powerful these very new machine learning techniques are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For this last \"preview\" course, we will be using [Keras](https://keras.io/) \"on Theano\" (or CNTK or TensorFlow, as you prefer [1]) to understand how to build a simple classifier with a neural network - that short-handedly beats all results you've seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Theano is probably well suited for teaching/learning networks, while Microsoft's CNTK is probably best suited for langauge modeling (of those three choices!) and Google's TensorFlow is certainly the best all-rounder and probably the most popular. If you already have something else than Theano (the default, AFAIK) set up with Keras, go with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Installing Keras](https://keras.io/#installation) is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install keras\n",
    "# or:\n",
    "pip3 install keras\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, [installing Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install) is easy, too, although getting it to work with your Nvidia GPU - assuming you have one in your laptop in the first place - might be more fidegty (see Theano's instructions about `libgpuarray` if you are not using `conda`, which does that for you via `pygpu`) - but still a lot simpler than with most other neural network libraries (if they are not supported by `conda`...)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install theano # no Nvidia GPU\n",
    "conda install theano pygpu # with Nvidia GPU support\n",
    "# or:\n",
    "pip install Theano[doc]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your instructor has a laptop without an Nvidia GPU, and this tutorial has been \"calibarated\" so that it can be run without one."

    "\n",
    "## Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "On day 3 we already have seen various ways to build your own word embeddings.\n",
    "Here we will take a \"shortcut\" and use a precomputed set of (single) word embeddings, [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), which is [hosted and distributed by Stanford](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/).\n",
    "We'll \"pretend\" that we are just trying to get a quick prototype running to see if our idea (multi-label classification of documents with convolutional networks) works.\n",
    "Once we've ensured it does, we can \"scale\" it to larger and/or more specific embeddings [1] and deeper networks (we'll use just a 1D conv net here).\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Generally, if you have the time and resources to build your own embeddings, you will always be better off with that avenue.\n",
    "As discussed before, is particularly true for capturing named entities and idioms that are highly specific for your specific domain and where the meaning of the collocations go beyond that of the single words.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are more of a fan of the FastText model, language-specific 300 dimensional word embeddings for a great many languages were [made available by Facebook's research department](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md) recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll just stick to the smallest possible set (in the hopes that your local laptops can cope with the data): please download `glove.6B.zip`, word embeddings created from WikiPedia, and will just use the 50 dimensional embeddings (again, in the hopes that this works on your laptops; if you have a GPU, use 100 dimensional set for a [little] performance gain - while the 300d set contributes no gains over 100d). Note the download is almost 1GB (\"As homework\" you can experiment with larger GloVe collections [42B, 840B] to see if that helps improve the final performance.)"

    "- Learn your own embeddings (ideally from a text collection matching your target domain), and make sure to add those collocations we discussed\n",
    "- Replace the old-school TF-IDF vectors with modern-day neural embeddings, but then learn an \"old school\" ML model, at least at first\n",
    "\n",
    "You will save yourself tons of time and pain, and still can tell your group leader/CTO/CEO that you built them a neural model\n",
    "(Remember, the word embeddings are also called \"neural embeddings\" and were learned from a (admittedly rather shallow...) perceptron.)\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, the challenge remains: How to actually beat the state-of-the-art in text classification with deep learning?\n",
    "At the very least: \"Its tricky\"!\n",
    "Very [well-designed conv nets](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44851-9_28), and rather [recent research on belief networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-016-2401-x) only very recently managed to claim to achieve the same ballpark results as the state-of-the-art results on \"old school\" models. But most of even the [current deep learning research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02733.pdf) still does not beat those \"old\" models on these two datasets.\n",
    "(Which is not to say that stuff like VAEs are very cool though - and probalby would unfold their \"full beauty\" if you had a much larger dataset - see next.)\n",
    "And probably by using LSTMs or GRU-RNNs to train sequence models might get you even beyond the state-of-the-art - if you have the resources and the data to even think of that, and an extensive amount of time to develop your classifier.\n",
    "(And then have the resources to run inference on that mega-model in production, too...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Take-home message\n",
    "\n",
    "In the opinion of your instructor, particularly the deep learning literature sadly is *littered* with evaluation results that claim to beat all former state-of-the-art, but indeed are quite frequently not much better (or ex-aequo, and often even worse) -- With computer vision, machine translation, and dependency parsing being the famous cases where deep learning indeed has \"pushed the envelope\" by a substantial margin *on the **same**, **public** (and often, small) community datasets* for evaluating the approach and comparing it to existing methods. And nearly no paper at all discusses how much more resources go into setting up, developing, training, and using deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, many other applications (apart from CV, MT, and DP) can profit from deep learning for the following reason:\n",
    "*Iff* you have much more training data (thousands, or even millions of examples per label), then, because deep learning can easily be scaled to work on such gigantic datasets, it indeed beats other methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forrests, Nearest Neighbours, Gradient Boosting, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, your instructor's personal experience is that unless you work for any (well known...) company that can spend hundreds of thousands (or much more!) of Dollars on developing such \"giga-sets\", you will not get to work with annotated data in that size-range.\n",
    "So, at the end of the day - deep learning is *very cool*, but you should take much of it with a *very large* grain of salt regarding how much time and money you can invest (particularly, given the current hype about it)."
